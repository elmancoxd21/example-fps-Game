If you need to modify or add something, enter the first person, two folder files will appear, one called moviment and the other mouse, each one handles a part of the character moviment handles if the player moves to a direction either with the letters wasd or with the arrows and the mouse script moves the character's camera with a blocking point so that they cannot move the camera beyond two already predefined points
